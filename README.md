### Project Description 

**What is the question you hope to answer?**
What factors such as sunspot activity are predictors of an increase in geomagnetic activity?

**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**
- Selected Geomagnetic indices from the 
National Geomagnetic Data Center ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/GEOMAGNETIC_DATA/INDICES/KP_AP/%23kp_ap.fmt%23


- Coronal Mass Ejection Catalog

**What do you know about the data so far?**
The Geomagnetic data looks to be complete and will provide information about atmospheric activity as well has average sunspot activity
CME Catalog data has many qualifiers on the measurements and will require the most shaping.

**Why did you chose this topic?**
In my spare time I'm an amateur astronomer.  Over the last few years I've catalog sunspot activity on my own and am interested in learning more.  I'm also concerned from a public policy perspective that we are not doing enough to prepare for another Carrington Event that would cripple power grid and take years to recover.

The Solar Storm of 1859 — known as the Carrington Event — was a powerful geomagnetic solar storm during solar cycle 10 (1855-1867). A solar coronal mass ejection hit Earth's magnetosphere and induced one of the largest geomagnetic storms on record.

I plan to use data around the October 23rd 2003 CME and need to identify other extreme events. 

**Hypothesis**
Sun spot activity will show some correlation to geomagnetic activity and CME speed will show a relatively higher correlation.
